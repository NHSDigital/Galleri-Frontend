# This read me file explains the structure  of cypress folders and files

E2E Tests: Place our end-to-end tests in the cypress/e2e folder. We can create separate .spec.js files for different features or user roles.

Accessibility Tests: Store our accessibility tests in the cypress/e2e/accessibility folder.

Component Tests: For component-level tests, use the cypress/e2e/component folder. We can create a .spec.js file for each React component we want to test in isolation.

API Tests: To test our AWS Lambda functions or other serverless endpoints, use the cypress/e2e/api folder. Create .spec.js files that make HTTP requests and assert the responses.

Performance Tests: Basic performance tests can go into the cypress/e2e/performance folder. These tests might include timing how long certain operations take and asserting that they complete within an acceptable time frame.

Cross-browser Tests: Cypress allows us to specify a browser when we run our tests. We don't necessarily need a separate folder for these tests. Instead, we can tag our spec files or describe blocks to indicate which ones should be run in multiple browsers, and then configure our CI/CD pipeline to run the tests in different browsers.

Fixtures: The cypress/fixtures folder is for storing static data that our tests might need.

Custom Commands: Any custom commands or utilities that we write can go into cypress/support/commands.js.

Plugins: If we use any Cypress plugins, we'll configure them in cypress/plugins/index.js.

Next Steps
Create these folders and example .spec.js files to get started.
Update our README.md or create a TESTING.md to document our testing strategy and folder structure.
As we write our tests, we can run them locally using the scripts we added to our package.json:
npm run cypress:open to open the Cypress UI.
npm run cypress:run to run the tests in headless mode.
