## Installation

To get started with this repo follow these steps:

git git@github.com:NHSDigital/Galleri-Frontend.git
cd cd Galleri-Frontend
```

2. Install dependencies

```shell

```

4. When this code is deployed into production it will use a port specified by an environmental variable, but you can run this locally to verify it works correctly:

```shell
PORT=8080 npm run start
```

### Prerequisites

nodejs - 16.20.0

## Usage

After a successful installation, provide an informative example of how this project can be used. Additional code snippets, screenshots and demos work well in this space. You may also link to the other documentation resources, e.g. the [User Guide](./docs/user-guide.md) to demonstrate more use cases and to show more features.

## Architecture

### Diagrams

The [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) is a simple and intuitive way to create software architecture diagrams that are clear, consistent, scalable and most importantly collaborative. This should result in documenting all the system interfaces, external dependencies and integration points.

### Configuration

Most of the projects are built with customisability and extendability in mind. At a minimum, this can be achieved by implementing service level configuration options and settings. The intention of this section is to show how this can be used. If the system processes data, you could mention here for example how the input is prepared for testing - anonymised, synthetic or live data.
